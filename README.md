# fireBaseLogin
This is a project that I made to gain an understanding of how authentication systems in our mobile phones allow only certain users to access information, which might be sensitive, on android applications.

## Summary
- Created a project on Firebase and linked it to the login/registration app I was working on in Android Studio
- Designed a simple layout for logging in and registering into an app
- Linked the XML files with the .java files using android id's
- Implemented the functionality to register, remember login details and to display messages on whether login or registration is successful
